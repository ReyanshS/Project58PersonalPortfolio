    <p>
      I love to play with my friends at the park every day or at home.
      
      We have a group of 6 - 8 people and we play pretty much every single day. One of my personal favorite game to play at the park is called grounders where as the tagger is blindfolded on structures but can see on the ground. If the tagger says "Grounders" when they are on the structure and someone is on the ground the person who was on the ground is it. 
      
      I really love playing with my friends you should try playing grounders.
